## Data Definition Language (DDL)

DDL commands are used to define and modify the structure of a database. These commands are crucial for creating and altering the schema of your database objects. Key DDL commands include:

- **CREATE**: Create new tables and databases.
- **ALTER TABLE**: Modify the structure of existing tables.
- **DROP**: Delete tables or databases.
- **TRUNCATE**: Remove all records from a table, but not the table itself.
- **ADD COLUMN**: Add new columns to an existing table.

## Data Manipulation Language (DML)

DML commands are used to access, manipulate, and modify data within the database. These commands are essential for data operations. Key DML commands include:

- **UPDATE**: Update existing records within a table.
- **DELETE**: Remove existing records from a table.
- **INSERT**: Insert new records into a table.

## Data Control Language (DCL)

DCL commands are used to control user access to the data within the database. These commands manage permissions and access rights. Key DCL commands include:

- **GRANT**: Grant specific privileges to a user or a group of users.
- **REVOKE**: Revoke specific privileges from a user or a group of users.

## Transaction Control Language (TCL)

TCL commands are used to manage transactions within the database, ensuring the integrity and consistency of data. Key TCL commands include:

- **COMMIT**: Save all changes made during the transaction.
- **SET TRANSACTION**: Set the properties for a transaction.
- **ROLLBACK**: Undo changes made during the current transaction.
- **SAVEPOINT**: Set a savepoint within a transaction for partial rollback.

## Data Query Language (DQL)

DQL commands are used to perform queries on the data within the database. These commands retrieve the necessary information from the database. The primary DQL command is:

- **SELECT**: Retrieve data from one or more tables.
